\olsection{Introduction}

Replacement is the axiom scheme which makes the difference between $\ZF$
and~$\Z$. We helped ourselves to it throughout
\crefrange{sth:ordinals::chap}{sth:spine::chap}. In this chapter, we
will finally consider the question: is Replacement justified? 

To make the question sharp, it is worth observing that Replacement is really
rather \emph{strong}. We will get a sense of just how strong it is, during this chapter (and again in \olref[sth][card-arithmetic][fix]{sec}). But this will suggest that justification really is required. 

We will discuss two kinds of justification. Roughly: an \emph{extrinsic} justification is an attempt to justify an axiom by its fruits; an \emph{intrinsic} justification is an attempt to justify an axiom by suggesting that it is vindicated by the mathematical concepts in question. We will get a greater sense of what this means during this chapter, but it is just the tip of an iceberg. For more, see in particular \citeauthor{Maddy1988a} (\citeyear{Maddy1988a} and \citeyear{Maddy1988b}).
